A small script that helps to create Markdown notes quickly, made for ease of note organizing.
Script adds current date in front of the name of the file and replaces spaces with "-" for ease of navigation:
%d-%m-%y-word1-word2-word3.md

Notes are saved in ~/Documents/notes/ 
After creation, notes are opened in Neovim.
Text editor and file location can be changed at the last two line of the file.
To invoke this script with one word add alias to ~/.bashrc
